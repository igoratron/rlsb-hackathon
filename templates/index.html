    <h1>About us </h1>
    <p>This site was created as part of a 2 day hackathon event,
        working with Royal London Society for Blind People to improve the lives of young blind Londoners and
        ultimately create a piece of technology
        to get blind people into employment. <br><br><br>
        2 out of 3 blind people are currently not in employment.
        47% of disabled people currently work compared to the 77% of non disabled people.
        Disabled people are more likely to be long term unemployed and economically inactive.
        Over half of disabled people claiming incapacity benefits have been out of work for more than 5 years.
        <br><br> <br><span>We aim to change this.</span> </p>
